# Detection-of-Cervical-Cancer-using-GLCM-Algorithm
This project aims at giving a very cost effective and precise technique to detect cervical cancer using Colposcopic images of patients.
I used GLCM algorithm to extract "Haralick features" from the images and did the training using SVM classifier. 
Finally I got an accuracy of 96.67% on test dataset and 98.83% on training dataset.
We were also able to publish a conference paper related to this project.
